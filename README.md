# Hi, I’m Awura 👋🏽

I am an aspiring Intelligent Systems Engineer, passionately exploring artificial intelligence
and automated systems. I’ve begun learning and building on my own, driven by curiosity
and a love for everything related to intelligent technologies.

My interests and projects focus on:
- Human-centered and ethical AI
- Intelligent and automated systems
- Storytelling as a tool to explain complex technologies
- Python, JavaScript, and web development projects

This GitHub is my playground for learning, experimenting, and showcasing projects that combine creativity, technology, and problem-solving.
